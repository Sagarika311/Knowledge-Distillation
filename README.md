# Knowledge Distillation with TensorFlow and Keras

The aim is to transfer knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model using Knowledge Distillation.

# Step 1: Importing the required modules
Import the following modules:

1. tensorflow: The main library for machine learning and neural networks
2. keras: High-level neural networks API, part of TensorFlow
3. numpy: Used for numerical operations on arrays

# Step 2: Creating the Distiller class
Create a custom Keras model for knowledge distillation:

- Inherits from keras.Model
- Takes a student model and a teacher model as inputs
- Implements custom compile() and train_step() methods
- Calculates both student loss and distillation loss

# Step 3: Creating the Teacher Model
Build a larger, more complex model as the teacher:

- Uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Has more filters and larger dense layer compared to the student

# Step 4: Creating the Student Model
Build a smaller, simpler model as the student:

- Also uses CNN architecture
- Has fewer filters and smaller dense layer compared to the teacher

# Step 5: Data Preparation
Prepare the MNIST dataset for training and testing:

- Load the MNIST dataset using keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
- Normalize the pixel values to be between 0 and 1
- Reshape the data to include a channel dimension

# Step 6: Training the Teacher Model
Train the teacher model on the MNIST dataset:

- Compile the model with Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss
- Train for 5 epochs on the training data
- Evaluate on the test data

# Step 7: Initializing and Compiling the Distiller
Set up the distillation process:

- Create a Distiller instance with the student and teacher models
- Compile with Adam optimizer, Sparse Categorical Accuracy metric
- Use Sparse Categorical Crossentropy for student loss and KL Divergence for distillation loss
- Set alpha (balance between losses) and temperature (softening of probability distributions)

# Step 8: Performing Knowledge Distillation
Train the student model using the distillation process:

- Use the fit() method of the Distiller
- Train for 3 epochs on the training data

# Step 9: Evaluating the Distilled Student Model
Test the performance of the student model after distillation:

- Use the evaluate() method of the Distiller on the test data

# Step 10: Training a Student Model from Scratch
For comparison, train a student model without distillation:

- Clone the original student model architecture
- Compile with the same settings as the teacher
- Train for 3 epochs on the training data
- Evaluate on the test data

This code demonstrates the process of Knowledge Distillation, where a smaller model (student) learns from a larger model (teacher). The distillation process allows the student to potentially achieve better performance than if it were trained from scratch, by leveraging the knowledge of the teacher model. The final step allows for a comparison between the distilled student and a student trained conventionally.
